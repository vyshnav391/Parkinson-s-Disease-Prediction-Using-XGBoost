# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction-Using-XGBoost
Description

This project implements a machine learning system to predict Parkinson’s Disease using biomedical voice measurements. The model leverages the XGBoost classification algorithm to identify patterns in vocal features associated with Parkinson’s Disease, achieving high predictive accuracy and robustness.

The project is designed for educational, research, and portfolio purposes, demonstrating best practices in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.

Problem Statement

Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects speech and motor control. Early diagnosis is challenging and often relies on clinical expertise.
The objective of this project is to build an automated machine learning model capable of predicting Parkinson’s Disease using voice-based features, assisting in early-stage detection and analysis.
