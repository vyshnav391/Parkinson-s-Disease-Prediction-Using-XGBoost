Problem Statement

Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects motor functions and speech. Early diagnosis is challenging, as symptoms may be subtle and often require expert clinical evaluation.

The goal of this project is to develop an automated machine learning model that predicts the presence of Parkinson’s Disease using voice-based biomedical features, thereby assisting in early-stage detection and clinical analysis.
